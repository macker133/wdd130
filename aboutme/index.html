    <h2>Aspiring dentist</h2>
    <p>I am currently studying Biomedical Science with the goal of becoming a dentist. My wife and I have been married for two and a half years. We were sealed in the Seattle temple.</p>
    <p>We met in her home town of Oak Harbor WA where I was stationed. I spent five years active duty in the Navy as an Avation Electronics Technician (AT). I deployed on CVN 72 the </p>
    <p>USS Abraham Lincoln, which is an aircraft carrier. I desire to learn more about web design because I believe it is an incredibly useful skill to have. I am intrested in learning</p> 
    <p>more about potential carreers associated with it, and I look forward to meeting you all.</p>
