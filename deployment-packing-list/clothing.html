          <p>Let's start with clothing. Besides your uniforms, you don’t need much clothing. It is highly recommended that you bring as many pairs of socks and underwear as you can fit in your sea bag. As mentioned earlier, laundry can be challenging, and maintaining hygiene is crucial. A minimum of fourteen pairs is required to last two weeks, but for deployment, it would be wise to have up to thirty. Remember, you will not be able to purchase more at sea. Do not be the smelly sailor in your berthing. There are social and legal consequences for improper hygiene. Workout clothes are required for use of the gyms on board. Seven to fourteen workout outfits are advised. Port calls are usually four days long. You will have a duty section for at least one day. If you are a fashion-conscious person and don’t want to wear the same three outfits while on liberty, then plan accordingly. Otherwise, three to four professional, civilian outfits are recommended. Be prepared for all weather conditions. The average deployment is nine months, meaning you should be prepared for anything. Plain white T-shirts are uniform items and not authorized to be worn as an outer garment, so do not plan on wearing them while on liberty.</p>

      <h2>Sleeping Arrangements</h2>
      <div id="sleepbackground">
        <p>	Next, lets discuss sleeping arrangements. If you are an officer or a family member of an officer in the United States Navy, then the sleeping arrangements covered in this guide do not apply to you. Consult an experienced officer in your command who can provide information about mattress sizes and storage space. This guide covers typical enlisted berthing arrangements for sleeping. There are many enlisted berths onboard the Nimitz-class carrier. Berthing sizes vary depending on their location. The typical berthing houses anywhere between 80 and 150 sailors. It is vitally important that a clean pair of bed sheets is on your packing list. Your ship will most likely have cotton sheets available, but the condition and cleanliness will vary. Aircraft carrier racks (beds) have unique mattress sizes. They have the length of an XL twin mattress but are approximately 10 inches slimmer in width than a standard twin. This poses a unique problem. Store-bought XL twin sheets will fit your rack; however, there will be a significant amount of excess material in the width that will allow the sheets to become easily untucked and messy. FleetSheets.com provides a solution to this problem by custom-making bed sheets to fit your rack. They also offer additional products to enhance your rack's comfort. If you are stationed aboard a carrier, it is highly recommended that you purchase a mattress pad to provide extra support. If you are in a squadron, it is unnecessary to purchase a mattress pad during workups. Detachments are short and not worth packing the extra weight. Bring a mattress pad for long-term deployments if needed. Bedding is important and has strict regulations on what you can and cannot bring. If you decide not to bring bedding, then the thick, scratchy wool blanket you used during boot camp will be the only option available for issuance. The pillows have literal feathers in them and are not comfortable to sleep with, either. Bring your pillow. All bedding must be made of natural materials to increase fire resistance. Synthetic materials, such as polyester, are not authorized and can be hazardous. Most sailors choose to bring sleeping bags. Sleeping bags must be made from natural fiber, NOT polyester. If you bring a sleeping bag made from plastic, there is the potential that it will be confiscated and replaced with a dreadful wool blanket. Cotton is your friend. My recommendation is to bring one natural fiber sleeping bag, a small blanket, one pillow, and three pairs of bed sheets. There won’t be enough room in your rack for more than one pillow, and laundry can be difficult, so having extra pairs of sheets is essential for hygiene. </p>
