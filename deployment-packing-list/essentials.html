          <p>Let’s cover miscellaneous items that can improve comfort. If you work on the flight deck, it is highly recommended to bring a CamelBak with a water pouch. Your command should issue you one. Suppose they don’t, bring one. A shower caddy helps bring soaps to and from the head (bathroom). A foldable mesh shower caddy is the best for conserving space. Toiletries, remember nine to twelve months’ worth if you don’t plan on replenishing your stock in a foreign country. If you are particular about specific brands of toothpaste, soap, and deodorant, then bring enough for the full duration. Bring multiple toothbrushes. Bring a portable power bank to charge your phone in port. It may be challenging to find an outlet in a foreign country, and if you do, you’ll probably need an adapter anyway. The easy solution is to have your battery. Bring two, maybe three phone chargers, in case yours breaks. Bring an external hard drive. Many experienced sailors have libraries of downloaded books and movies. If you have an external hard drive (SSD recommended for longevity), you can share it. Command hooks, tape, paracord, and carabiners are all helpful in hanging items up. Combination locks are proper. You don’t want to worry about losing your keys, so make sure to lock up your rack and locker. Full-size microfiber travel towels are handy for saving space. They also dry quicker and accumulate less bacteria. Bring three towels at a minimum. For some reason, dishonest sailors love stealing dirty towels. Scent beads and air fresheners help keep your locker smelling fresh. Bring a strong laundry bag with backpack straps for transporting your laundry to and from the laundry room. Portable stick-on lights help illuminate your locker and rack. Bring extra batteries for personal electronics.</p>

      <h2>Health and Wellness</h2>
      <p>Bring vitamins and cold medicine. You will be in proximity to others in a dirty environment. Illness spreads fast; be prepared. Finally, the most essential thing to bring is a comprehensive first aid kit. Ship Medical is stingy about first aid supplies. The ship is filthy. Even the most minor cuts and scrapes will get infected if not treated. Bring a first aid kit if you don’t want to rely on medical assistance. Bring ringworm and athlete’s foot cream. You will be in your boots for eighteen hours a day. If you get wet, it is unlikely that your shoes will dry before putting them back on again. Ringworm and athlete’s foot outbreaks are common, and medical supplies run out of medicine fast. Stay safe, and thank you for your service.</p>
