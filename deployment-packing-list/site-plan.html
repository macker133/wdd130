      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The goal of this website is to provide junior sailors in the United States Navy with helpful information about what living quarters are like aboard a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier and to provide a recommended packing list of items that will make life aboard more comfortable.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience for this website is any United States Sailor who is preparing for an extended underway at sea and is seeking information about what to bring with them. The most likely audience would be junior sailors fresh out of training; however, this website could be used as a training resource for anyone attached to an aircraft carrier. </p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Congratulations on the Opportunity to Serve Aboard a U.S. Carrier</h3>
      <p>
        Preparing for an extended underway on an aircraft carrier can be intimidating. There are no Walmart’s in the middle of the ocean to visit in case you forget something. Whether you’re a brand-new junior enlisted sailor, a lucky senior enlisted sailor who’s avoided sea duty, or a family member attending a tiger cruise, this website will provide a comprehensive packing guide to prepare you for life at sea aboard one of the world’s most powerful warships.

      </ul>
      <h3>Clothing & Comfort</h3>
      <h4>Clothing</h4>
      <p1>
        Let’s start with clothing. Besides your uniforms, you really don’t need much clothing. It is highly recommended that you bring as many pairs of socks and underwear as you can possibly fit in your sea bag. As mentioned earlier, laundry is difficult, and hygiene is important. A minimum of fourteen pairs to last two weeks is required but, for deployment it would be wise to have up to thirty. Remember, you will not be able to purchase more at sea. Do not be the smelly sailor in your berthing. There are social and legal consequences for improper hygiene. Workout clothes are required for use of the gyms on board. Seven to fourteen workout outfits is advised. Port calls are usually four days long. You will have duty section for at least one day. If you are a fashionable person, and don’t want to wear the same three outfits while on liberty then plan accordingly, otherwise three to four professional, civilian outfits are recommended. Be prepared for all weather conditions. The average deployment is nine months, meaning you should be prepared for anything. Plain white tee shirts are uniform items and not authorized to be worn as an outer garment so do not plan on wearing them while on liberty.

      <h5>Sleeping Arrangments</h5>
      <p2>Next we will cover sleeping arrangements. If you are an officer or a family member of an officer in the United States Navy, then the sleeping arrangements covered in this guide are not applicable to you. Consult an experienced officer in your command who can provide information about mattress sizes and storage space. This guide covers typical enlisted berthing sleeping arrangements. There are many enlisted berthing’s onboard the Nimitz class carrier. Berthing sizes vary depending on their location. The typical berthing houses anywhere between 80-150 sailors. It is vitally important that a clean pair of bed sheets are on your packing list. Your ship will most likely have cotton sheets available, but the condition and cleanliness will vary. Aircraft carrier racks (beds) have unique mattress sizes. They have the length of an XL twin mattress but are approximately 10 inches slimmer in width than a standard twin. This poses a unique problem. Store bought XL twin sheets will fit your rack; however, there will be a significant amount of excess material in the width that will allow the sheets to become easily untucked and messy. FleetSheets.com provides a solution to this problem by custom making bed sheets to fit your rack. They also provide other products to make your rack more comfortable. If you are stationed aboard a carrier, it is highly recommended to purchase a mattress pad that will provide extra support. If you are in a squadron, it is unnecessary to purchase a mattress pad during work ups. Detachments are short and not worth packing the extra weight. Bring a mattress pad for long-term deployments if needed. Bedding is important and has strict regulations on what you can and cannot bring. If you decide not to bring bedding, then the thick scratchy wool blanket that you used during bootcamp will be all that is available for issuance. The pillows have literal feathers in them and are not comfortable to sleep with either. Bring your own pillow. All bedding must be made of natural materials to increase fire resistance. Synthetic materials such as polyester are not authorized and dangerous. Most sailors choose to bring sleeping bags. Sleeping bags must be made from natural fiber, NOT polyester. If you bring a sleeping bag made from plastic, there is the potential that it will be confiscated and replaced with dreadful wool blanket. Cotton is your friend. My personal recommendation is to bring one natural fiber sleeping bag, a small blanket, one pillow, and three pairs of bed sheets. There won’t be enough room in your rack for more than one pillow and laundry can be difficult, so having extra pairs of sheets are essential for hygiene.</p2>

      <h3>Essentials</h3>
      <h6>Miscelaneous Items</h6>
      <p>
        Let’s cover miscellaneous items that can improve moral. If you work on the flight deck, it is highly recommended to bring a camel back with a water pouch. Your command should issue you one. If they don’t, bring one. A shower caddy is useful for bringing soaps to and from the head (bathroom). A foldable mesh shower caddy is the best for conserving space. Toiletries, remember nine - twelve months’ worth if you don’t plan on replenishing your stock in a foreign country. If you are particular about specific brands of toothpaste, soap, and deodorant then bring enough for the full duration. Bring multiple toothbrushes. Bring a portable power bank to charge your phone in port. It may be difficult to find an outlet in a foreign country and if you do, you’ll probably need an adapter anyways. The easy solution is to have your own battery. Bring two, maybe three phone chargers, in case yours breaks. Bring an external hard drive. Many experienced sailors have libraries of downloaded books and movies. If you have an external hard drive (SSD recommended for longevity) then you can share. Command hooks, tape, paracord, and carabiners are all useful for hanging items up. Combination locks are useful. You don’t want to worry about losing your keys, and you must lock up your rack and locker. Full size microfiber travel towels are incredibly useful for saving space. They also dry quicker and accumulate less bacteria. Bring three towels at a minimum. For some reason dishonest sailors love stealing dirty towels. Scent beads and air fresheners are useful for keeping your locker smelling fresh. Bring a strong laundry bag with backpack straps for transporting your laundry to and from the laundry room. Portable stick-on lights are useful for illuminating your locker and rack. Bring extra batteries for personal electronics. Bring your favorite form of entertainment. Some sailors like eBooks, others like video games and will bring their device of choice, others prefer movies and tv shoes, Bring your favorites and enjoy the free time you have.
      </p>
      <h7>Health and Wellness</h7>
      <p>Bring vitamins and cold medicine. You will be in close proximity with others in a dirty environment. Illness spreads fast, be prepared. If you take supplements such as protein powder or amino acids, zip lock bags are useful for conserving space and fit well in authorized bulkhead crevices for storage. You can find thicker more durable bags on Amazon. Finally, the most important thing that you must bring is a comprehensive first aid kit. Ship medical is stingy about first aid supplies. The ship is incredibly dirty. Even the smallest cuts and scrapes will get infected if not treated. Bring a first aid kit if you don’t want to fight medical. Bring ring worm and athletes’ foot cream. You will be in your boots for eighteen hours a day. If you get wet, it is unlikely that your boots will dry before putting them back on again. Ringworm and athlete’s foot outbreaks are common and medical runs out of medicine fast. Stay safe, and thank you for your service. </p>
